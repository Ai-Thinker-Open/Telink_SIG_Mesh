/**
 * \defgroup mmem Managed memory allocator
 *
 * The managed memory allocator is a fragmentation-free memory
 * manager. It keeps the allocated memory free from fragmentation by
 * compacting the memory when blocks are freed. A program that uses
 * the managed memory module cannot be sure that allocated memory
 * stays in place. Therefore, a level of indirection is used: access
 * to allocated memory must always be done using a special macro.
 *
 * \note This module has not been heavily tested.
